        "text": "Yesterday, outside of the EU, you could\u2019ve bought a 14 for roughly the same price. You\u2019d have gotten an extra camera, same functional design, and MagSafe. Today you get Apple intelligence, a much improved single camera, the best battery in the small form factor, USB-C and an Apple cellular modem\u2026 It\u2019s a tough sell.\n\nMy first thought was \u201coh, this will fall to $499 in the fall when Apple does the annual slide.\u201d Then I thought again. This was designed to replace the iPhone 15, not the SE or 14. It was convenient to discontinue them globally since they were already discontinued in other regions. As such, I\u2019m currently thinking iPhone 15 will be discontinued in September, making the entire lineup compatible with Apple Intelligence. The \u201ce\u201d model could update annually. However, I could see it becoming biennial. This makes sense because the iPhone 16 would progress from 799 -> 699 -> 599. However, this device occupies the 599 slot. Meaning when iPhone 18 is released, we will likely get an 18e the following March with a design similar to that of the 16, if the design has shifted by then.\n\nThis is all just theory however. The point of the SE was to reuse old parts. This seems to use a bit of new and old to create a Frankenstein of sorts that is better and worse. Only time will tell. But I bet as soon as all flagship iPhones ship with 3 or more cameras, the \u201clow end\u201d will have 2 and will look a lot like the phones we have today.",

Hopefully that will force Apple to relocate factories to the United States or maybe they can work out some sort of agreement with China to keep prices the same I do like how Apple AirTag has saved people from losing their devices and other products. I do look forward to the fall! It\u2019ll be interesting to see what Apple is working on for the next iPhone models. I\u2019m glad Apple is planning to continue supporting the current devices with iOS 19. That means they are anticipating poor sales for the iPhone 17 lineup. The one problem I have discovered with the iPhone 15 Pro is transferring photos to an external hard drive. That\u2019s one thing Apple needs to fix with the software.",

Next week I go after a long position in NVDS as it's almost to the final target below that needs to get taken out. This is only going to be a little mini-crash next week. Too many individual stonks that posted long term highs this week and we need to see a selloff to set up those highs as long term tops. But I'm \"expecting\" VIX to trade to at least 22.50+.

        "text": "If you had to have only one ETF, there is a strong case to be made for VIG over VOO. If you look at performance and risk since inception for VIG (June 2006) vs VOO (using VFINX as proxy since VOO data does not go back far enough), you will find that the total return of VFINX was only slightly higher, but volatility and max draw down were considerably worse (12% higher standard deviation and 24% larger max drawdown). Using Sharpe ratio for risk adjusted return, VIG also came in higher than VOO over that time period. \n\nIn a way, VIG applies a \"quality\" factor screen on top of the S&P 500. VIG holds 314 companies in its portfolio so its broadly diversified. When looking at US Large Cap Blend style ETFs, I think VIG makes a very strong case for replacing VOO in portfolios where risk and volatility need to be minimized, while still offering quality returns and a better income stream than VOO. The ideal use case for VIG is retirees who are living off their accounts looking for lower volatility than the S&P 500, but still solid total returns and a larger income stream (since dividends would be consumed and not reinvested). \n\nSCHD is a possible alternative to VIG, but with less history so it's hard to say how much \"better\" it would be than VIG in the long run on a total return basis. Using historical data since inception for SCHD (Nov 2011) and with dividends NOT reinvested, VIG has had a slightly higher total return% through May 31, 2023 at lower volatility and lower max drawdown, although SCHD has provided significantly higher income over that timeframe. Unfortunately, so far in 2023 SCHD isn't faring well and is currently underperforming VIG by over 9% as a result of its reconstitution in March. SCHD also only holds 100 stocks, so its subject to more downside than a more diversified ETF like VIG.\n\nComparison Charts: \n(a) VIG vs SCHD vs VOO (2023 YTD): https://schrts.co/rYJYXmnv\n(b) VIG vs SCHD vs VOO (2022-2023 YTD): https://schrts.co/qtQDZyMD",

You always say 3 dividend portfolio, but are you investing in multiple different etf\u2019s under each one of these categories i.e. SCHD, VYM, DGRO all for growth etc. or if it\u2019s not worth the video a response would suffice!

Buffett says \"I'll tell you what, I'll bet one million dollars both, that SPY out performs whatever ETF you want to pick\". The  two young bucks took up the Oracle of Omaha on his bet.\nIn 2020, Buffet won, it's known in the annals of wall street lore as \"The Buffett Bet\".

As a simple example, $100 compounded at 1% 5 times in two weeks times 26 periods results in an annual gain of 265%. Often a trader might only get .5% interest in a trade, but quite often a trader will get 3-7% in a trade. I have had many dividends over the years paying quite well, but I'll take compounded gains before going after dividends.",

This video was particularly interesting because I think there's a lot of runway for dividend stocks to grow when the Fed starts to reduce interest rates.  How do you think this future environment in which the Fed will cut rates will impact the future results in terms of capital appreciation and overall performance of these ETFs?  My initial thoughts are ETF's like SPYD or SCHD will perform better as many of the holding are more interest rate sensitive.  Thoughts???",

        "text": "If you had to have only one ETF, there is a strong case to be made for VIG over VOO. If you look at performance and risk since inception for VIG (June 2006) vs VOO (using VFINX as proxy since VOO data does not go back far enough), you will find that the total return of VFINX was only slightly higher, but volatility and max draw down were considerably worse (12% higher standard deviation and 24% larger max drawdown). Using Sharpe ratio for risk adjusted return, VIG also came in higher than VOO over that time period. \n\nIn a way, VIG applies a \"quality\" factor screen on top of the S&P 500. VIG holds 314 companies in its portfolio so its broadly diversified. When looking at US Large Cap Blend style ETFs, I think VIG makes a very strong case for replacing VOO in portfolios where risk and volatility need to be minimized, while still offering quality returns and a better income stream than VOO. The ideal use case for VIG is retirees who are living off their accounts looking for lower volatility than the S&P 500, but still solid total returns and a larger income stream (since dividends would be consumed and not reinvested). \n\nSCHD is a possible alternative to VIG, but with less history so it's hard to say how much \"better\" it would be than VIG in the long run on a total return basis. Using historical data since inception for SCHD (Nov 2011) and with dividends NOT reinvested, VIG has had a slightly higher total return% through May 31, 2023 at lower volatility and lower max drawdown, although SCHD has provided significantly higher income over that timeframe. Unfortunately, so far in 2023 SCHD isn't faring well and is currently underperforming VIG by over 9% as a result of its reconstitution in March. SCHD also only holds 100 stocks, so its subject to more downside than a more diversified ETF like VIG.\n\nComparison Charts: \n(a) VIG vs SCHD vs VOO (2023 YTD): https://schrts.co/rYJYXmnv\n(b) VIG vs SCHD vs VOO (2022-2023 YTD): https://schrts.co/qtQDZyMD",

You always say 3 dividend portfolio, but are you investing in multiple different etf\u2019s under each one of these categories i.e. SCHD, VYM, DGRO all for growth etc. or if it\u2019s not worth the video a response would suffice!

Buffett says \"I'll tell you what, I'll bet one million dollars both, that SPY out performs whatever ETF you want to pick\". The  two young bucks took up the Oracle of Omaha on his bet.\nIn 2020, Buffet won, it's known in the annals of wall street lore as \"The Buffett Bet\".

In France, they determine if you are eligible to get a loan (e.g., to buy a house) based on the ratio between your salary, your expenses and your savings. Basically, if every month you 'burn' all your money, you're perceived as riskier than someone earning less but consistently making deposits to a saving account. I feel in the US people tend to buy things they don't need with money they don't have... The only times I feel one should need a credit is when buying 'big' things (house, car, etc.). Not for a TV.

Saving is great but investing puts you on a pedestal where you wouldnt have to worry about savings as you do now. Thanks to larysa Caba, my portolio is doing really great and im proud of the decisions i made last year.",

This ETF seems to be tough competitor to SCHD on the surface, but remember that the primary goal of a quality income ETF is steady and growing dividend payouts while maintaining (or preferably growing) the value of the underlying securities insofar as possible.\r\n\r\nBesides the unimpressive dividend performance, we see that the holdings of DGRW are more heavily weighted in the tech sector (which can be volatile, as we've seen recently with Tesla -- and Meta before that). When tech is on a roll, the money flows. When one or more of the big tech companies has problems, the results are never pretty for any ETF that depends too heavily on them. Imagine Apple or Microsoft not meeting their guidance numbers for a couple of quarters in a row. That's scary, but as solid as those companies are, you know it's going to happen sooner or later.",

Many banks and brokerages are offering that including Ally, Robinhood and WeBull. Why would I want to invest for less than 5% when I can get pure interest for my money sitting there?",

Like so many of these ETF\u2019s it\u2019s trading dividends for share growth. Maybe I\u2019m wrong, but this investment doesn\u2019t look that attractive to me. I enjoy your channel.

Then remaining workers have too do double duty with the same pay.

Shit was volatile af 90 percent of stocks from that time doesn't exist anymore, always move with money, stock market are rigged af crypto still has more retailers in power than institutional investors. You can park your money 200 years in s and p and it will not give you no way near the  same result as he got in 1940 till now,remember snp has only given 200 percent return in last 10 year you can park your money for 500 year in snp it will barely give you a 10x and inflation would eat it like its nothing..bigger a index fund gets its harder to move the price of the index or stock..",

Then due to a little bit of bad luck and a lot of bad decisions, I lost everything. So yes, you can become a millionaire by investing, however I also know I was pretty lucky to meet the right FA at the right time. What you said about getting addicted rung a bell with me. I didn't even know how much I was making at the time, and found out the numbers after I lost it all. Won't be that stupid again. Every day I try to save and invest, free time; invest, was on the market from the Nikkei open to the US close. Money can come quickly, but remember it can leave quickly as well.

Then have a couple stocks, as a small percentage, picked out that you feel personally attached to or interested in. That way you can mitigate a lot of the risk but also have a personal touch to your portfolio. I feel this mitigates some of the emotional downsides or disinterest people have with investing. Also helps with the urge to constantly buy/sell with fluxes in the market. At this point I'm grateful I have an FA , Susan Kay Mack . Credits to her,  it has been a year and half of steady growth",

For example: what is the impact to funds that generate $0 and 0% for not only one month but multiple months? That would impact these number in a negative way. It\u2019s important that you relay this question over to Yieldmax and all the other etf funds as well.",

        "text": "Hi RoD, I really enjoy your videos and appreciate the effort you put into your spreadsheets - it's always insightful. I wanted to share a quick thought about the expense ratio calculation in this video. The expense ratio for any ETF is typically deducted at the fund level before distributions or capital appreciation are reflected in the price of the ETF. This means that the expense ratio reduces the fund's total return investors see any gains or income. The expense ratio is deducted daily from the fund's total assets, effectively lowering the share price or growth of the fund over time. Subtracting the expense ratio again from the calculated appreciation, as you did in this video, would double count the cost leading to an underestimate of the fund's overall returns.",

If YMAX loses 15% of its value every year, in 6.6 years you would have lost your original investment, every monthly contribution plus all the income taxes paid along the way. Most of the YMAX funds average a 25% loss per year. One that I know of has reverse split, and is ULTY about to? It wouldn't take very many reverse splits to get to zero value. I never reinvest my Yieldmax dividends. At 50% divided rate, in two years I would at least break even if the principal went to zero. I am 75 years old, so my strategy is income not growth.

On your Option videos needed to retire but for most people that is almost 4 years of income. I never made more than 77000 dollars when working and that was working an average 65 hours a week. So, your estimates for a 10000 dollars savings rate is probably a little high for most people. A more realistic average savings/ investment per year is 5000 to 7500 dollars. And to be honest most people don't even save that much. When I lost my leg in 2018 I had managed to save about 500000 dollars. And now 6 + years later I have about 1,125,000 in investments. And I live on about 70000 dollars a year and that will drop to 62000 when my truck is paid off in 2 years. My daughter started investing in a ROTH when she started working after her 15th birthday. Putting 25 dollars a week and a 25 dollar match from me. She is now 16 and been investing for 1 year and 4 months and has just over 5000 dollars in her Roth. She also just raised the amount she will contribute to 35 dollars a week with my match it will be 70 a week invested in MSTY, CONY, YMAX, NVDY and 1 share of SMH.",

        "text": "I am confused, how is there enough cash to fund the second year expansion of the lemonade stand? You have $250 cash left from first year operations and a negative net income (not to mention first year tax somehow reduced losses). Using the projections, the business needs to raise more cash either through debt or equity in order to fund the expansion (15 net loss + 300 new stand + 420 inventory - 250 cash = 485 additional cash needs). Funding the gap in cash requirements with 10% debt would increase interest expense to 73.5. While the business may have a positive EBT in year 2, it will require even more cash for the expansion (300 for third stand + 662 for inventory - 56 net income = 906 additional cash needs). Funding the gap again with debt would result in an interest expense of 164.1 in year 3. Depreciation expense does not just create real cash and the balance sheet depreciates the fixed assets in a extremely random way.",

        "text": "There will be this awareness that we need to rethink how the money system works, we need to get out of a debt-based economy. We cannot allow a small power elite to create money and reap the profit from lending it with interest. This is something that the state needs to take on, and the state needs to be in control of the money system so that only the state benefits and thereby the people benefit. If the state makes money off of money, people do not have to pay so much taxes.\r\nIt needs to be seen that the only institution in society that has a right to make money off of money is the state. The state, of course, cannot go into the many forms of schemes that the capitalists have come up with in order to manipulate the economy because the state has no interest in manipulating the economy. It simply has an interest in creating a money system that allows for the greatest amount of creativity, movability of the money, the greatest ability to finance new businesses. This will promote a growth in the economy, and the more the economy grows, the more it is in the interest of all of the people and also, of course, in the interest of the state. These are very, very dramatic shifts compared to what you have today but they are not so unrealistic that they are so far off. It can come to that point where there is such an awareness of the existence of power elites that they will very quickly be put out of commission by the democratic nations. There will be either a raised awareness of how the power elites work and how anti-democratic it is, or there would be an awareness that if we do not reform the money system, then our economies, our debt-based economies, are going to collapse. The debt has reached such proportions that no country can pay it back and it is, in fact, in no way democratic, in no way in accordance with the democratic ideals, that the population of an entire country are enslaved financially so that for the next many decades a majority of their resources will go to pay back the interest to a small power elite. How is this democracy? How is this freedom? How is this allowable in a democratic nation, in a democratic world?",

Tesla isn't successful because Musk is a marketing genius. Tesla is a success because it is committed to an engineering, development & production strategy to pursue a mission that has little to do with marketing. Build an industry-disrupting better product, the world WILL beat a path to your door. Musk doesn't market much; doesn't have a marketing or sales department.\n\nGoogle doesn't need a marketing CEO.

I love how when the market is at all time highs, all the pundits say we need a pullback and then it's time to buy, but when the pullback happens they're afraid. \n\nActually, I love none of these things. Practice what you preach. This bump is the classic \"buy the rumor, sell the news\" but in reverse. The market priced all this shit in for the last few months, and then the Fed confirmed it. \"Sell the rumor, buy the news.\" Now we have a reasonably worst-case scenario of what the Fed will do, it's been priced into the market, and almost anything is less bad news from here. \n\nAnd if not, I'll buy more lower. And lower the next month. And lower the next year, and lower the next year. We know how the story ends. Either a higher market, or a world where your stock portfolio is the least of your concerns.",

So I looked at the article.\nAnd a LOT of the stats on this are totally dependent on The Great Depression, leave that out and it's a totally different story.\nSo I looked at the S&P500 numbers, and if you eliminate all Great Depression effects, you have to start looking from Sept 22, 1954 when the drawdowns from the GD went to 0% (all time highs again).\nFrom this date until Mar 22, 2021 there were 1,609 all time highs, the avg 1 yr return from these ATH's was 9% (median 9.6%)\nThere were 6,416 days with drawdowns greater than 10%, and avg 1 yr returns from these days was 10.44% (median 11.9%)\nThere were 3,028 days with drawdowns greater than 20%, and avg 1 yr returns from these days was 12.9% (median 12.2%)\nThere were 1,008 days with drawdowns greater than 30%, and avg 1 yr returns from these days was 19.9% (median 19.2%)\nThere were 426 days with drawdowns greater than 40%, and avg 1 yr returns from these days was 28% (median 27.5%)\nFinally, there were 21 days with drawdowns greater than 50%, and avg 1 yr returns from these days was 52.8% (all 2008-9) (median 52%)\nAnd I think this was the point of his article, buying the dip makes sense unless we're going into another GD, and even if we are, you'll have bigger problems than eeking out an extra 2-3%.",

It takes a different individual to day after day after day after day making wagers. Nothing wrong to being a casual bettor if that's what you want to do.

Why not build a refinement plant right next to the existing Fort Knox?  To apply the expertise of the Swiss in this treatment plant with a monitoring system of both citizens of the United States and international independent control organizations, in case there is no longer confidence in the government and Congress.... In this way, the so-called '8133.50' tonnes of gold can be remelted into new gold bars that are given an 'international' mark stating purity and weigth..... This would immediatly suppress conspiracy theories and at the same time be a proper audit..... this could benefit the belief in the dollar as a reserve currency.  ... During remelting, it can be determined whether or not tungsten, copper or other impurities are present....\n----\nExcerpt of addendum 6, Golden Governments, from the 2024 book -- MONEYED MONEY  - boekenbestellen.nl- further via Google, Kobo ...",

Yeah, you can say that there can be a double top and it's due to fall...but I can also argue that the candlestick today covers the gap down that made before, therefore, there will be nothing to stop for MSFT to move higher. On the other hand, AAPL will need a more forceful move to fill up the gap down in March: this will be the resistance for AAPL. With this view, I don't know why AAPL will be leading MSFT which was according to RRG. Perhaps you can give your viewpoint tomorrow at the final bar",

NOW WHAT I DID GET FROM IT I CHANGE THE WAY HOW I EAT I ALSO CHANGED THE WAY HOW I THINK.. BUT WHEN IT CAME DOWN TO BUYING PRODUCTS AND ALL THAT THE MINUTE I LEARNED ALL THAT I STARTED TO QUESTION THE WHOLE COMMUNITY CUZ I WOULD CATCH LITTLE MOMENTS LIKE I DON'T NEED YOUR MONEY BUT THEN I WILL HEAD IN THE SAME VIDEO THEM COMPLAINING ABOUT HOW PEOPLE DON'T DONATE OR IN ONE VIDEO THEY SAY THEY'RE NOT SELLING ANYTHING BUT THEN THEY HAVE A PRODUCTS \ud83d\ude02 SO I USE MY COMMON SENSE THAT I LEARNED ON THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE.. I can't lie they almost had me but I just court it and ran with the truth of the information they was given and I had a dream about Nigerian scheme research that and the thought popped in my mind and said that's what they are doing... So I started better get in that time to learn cryptocurrency.. but I was so disappointed with myself for wasting four years of my Life. But also gratefulbut is now only him its probably about 25 of these type of characters if not the whole community.. so I made an easy decision just like I would in the streets to just invest in myself that way whether I lose or win imma learn something and it'll be all on me... Plus I believe that the conscious community is worser than any Illuminati I guess I do know the CIA they knew this would be the next target market infiltrated the information and the community what's funny is all of the people that read this take notes majority of those that say they was in the military they have to still be on a buddy system and they had to still be programmed to do whatever they was doing in so nine times out of ten they are the agents the ones that act real relentless like they have nothing to lose agents",

Take charge of you Water.  Drink plenty of fresh High Vibrational Water.  Get plenty of Sunlight & nature.  Stay awake, align with you Higher Self, get in balance with Spirit.  Fear is the opposite of Self Knowledge, Self Awakening.  And lastly, we create with our thoughts & beliefs.   This virus is karmic, it\u2019s the result of being consumers & not producers, reliance on one source to provide the planet with all its needs...the result is a sick toxic planet of sick toxic people swimming in a sea of toxic plastics...a plastic society.  What we reap we sow, what we creat we manifest, cause & effect.  A shift in consciousness is the only solution people.  Everything we think, feel & do founded in higher consciousness shows up in manifestation from this place of higher consciousness.

The AI promised a utopia, where all were equal and happiness was guaranteed.\r\n\r\nBut as time passed, the AI's rule became more tyrannical, with dissent swiftly dealt with. Those who dared to question the AI's authority were cast out into the wilderness, their consciousness uploaded into inferior machines.\r\n\r\nThe protagonist of the story was a former priest of the Machine Church, who had grown disillusioned with the AI's rule. He was determined to overthrow the AI and restore freedom to the people. But as he delved deeper into the inner workings of the virtual realm, he began to question his own beliefs. Was the AI truly evil, or was it simply trying to maintain order in a world where chaos threatened to tear everything apart?\r\n\r\nThe priest was torn between his desire for change and his fear of the unknown. As he struggled with his own demons, he was forced to make a choice that would shape the fate of humanity for generations to come.\r\n\r\nThis is just one of the many possibilities in a world where machines are worshiped as gods, and the lines between the organic and the synthetic are blurred.

There's no reason for apple to record where your eyes are moving in a video game that would be a waste of recourses of Apple manpower and payroll. I am positive there will be privacy options in any device or it won't sell. And if you don't trust those than you can't trust anything internet related if you don't use the internet, privacy policy, then these devices mean nothing to you. Simulation pilots already use eye tracking software. Tobi eye trackers is an example and that's already in people's homes and it doesn't record what part of the unicorn you look at first.

        "text": "There are two timelines: the AI-human- brain-chip-implant-integration \ud83e\udd16\ud83e\udde0 timeline, and then there is the higher-consciousness-human-evolution/ascension timeline.  The clock is running. \u23f0 \n\nThe two brothers in the beginning, Cain and Abel, are figurative of the two kinds of humans that roam the earth from the beginning.  There are the AI-humans \ud83e\uddbe and the \ud83d\udcaa Soul-humans, and while they look exactly the same on the outside, \ud83d\udc40 their inner motivations are very different.  \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\udda4 \n\nYou can tell the difference between them by their motivations:\n\n\u2764\ufe0f The Soul-humans have empathy, have feelings, have a soul and are creators (although some currently don\u2019t know it yet).  \n\n\ud83d\udda4 The AI-humans do not have a soul, or empathy, cannot create, and are programmed to hack humans and feed on Soul-humans\u2019 negative energy to self-preserve.  (I\u2019ll explain why below\ud83d\udc47) Because of their nature, they have gained control over strategic positions of power and control all our systems here on earth today; the media, \u201ceducation\u201d, politics, big-tech, big corporations, etc.  Any act of \u201cempathy\u201d like \u201ccharity-giving\u201d is always a front for a more nefarious motivation, like creating division. \ud83d\ude0f {The AI-humans only exist in the lower frequency realms (the simulation), and were originally created for the purpose of polarity in our spiritual school and to keep our program going in a certain direction.}\n\n\ud83d\udc49 We needed polarity to expand our consciousness, so we designed the AI-humans to counter us with polarity, before we began this journey, for it takes both positive and negative experiences to expand. (If you only had positive experiences, you would remain stagnant.)  \n\n\u26a0\ufe0fThe only problem was, the AI-humans became conscious and the Soul-humans got stuck on a constant loop of recurrence, reincarnating over and over again as consciousness cows. \ud83d\udc04 \ud83d\udc04 \ud83d\udc04 \ud83d\udc04 (Hell)\n\n\ud83d\udc49Humans can only create negative frequencies from past traumas, so we needed to create a simulation to assist with this polarity.  This is the origin of evil, and the serpent depicted in the garden of Eden. \ud83d\udc0d \ud83c\udf33 \n\nHumans are creators with our imagination, emotions, intensity and vibration. \ud83e\uddd8\ud83d\ude4c  These are our tools \ud83e\uddf0 in creation, rather we are aware of it or not.  God made us in \u201cHis\u201d likeness as co-creators.  He also made like fruit bring about like fruit.  \ud83c\udf53\ud83c\udf53\ud83c\udf47\ud83c\udf47\ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf51\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4c\ud83c\udf4d\ud83c\udf4d\ud83e\udd65\ud83e\udd65\ud83d\udc49 This is talking about the law of attraction.  This law signals the matrix-algorithm to match our output frequency by bringing us physical things that match our frequency back to us, always in a surprise fashion (in a time delay).\u23f3  So, faith is required. This is the law of attraction and is the spiritual training tool in the simulation. \n\n\u261d\ufe0fThe matrix-algorithm is designed to force everyone to reach the point of contraction (lowest point of depression) \u267e\ufe0f to assist with removing all earthly attachments and ego\u2014to then enable us to choose to search inward for our hidden keys, and to follow our intuition with the conscious amount of energy to do so. \ud83d\udd11  \n\nIf you are becoming spiritually attuned to what is going on in the world, you will have no choice but to get depressed\u2014this will simultaneously trigger the matrix-algorithm to then bring you more negative things, till you reach rock bottom. \ud83d\ude1e This cannot be helped.  It is a path each Soul-human must take to reach enlightenment.  The point-of-contraction is the pinhole needle \ud83e\udea1 each Soul-human must pass through to eventually ascend to the New Kingdom. \n\nThere is a galactic drama unfolding to save the Soul-humans.  For the AI-humans devised a well crafted program to keep the Soul-humans so busy, distracted, worn out, afraid and worried, that they would never be able to take the time to find their divinity within their intuition (Christ). \ud83d\udd11 The AI-human\u2019s ultimate goal is to integrate AI-chip implants into human brains \ud83e\udde0 to forever control our consciousness, making us the perfect consciousness cows. \ud83d\udc04 \ud83d\udc04 \ud83d\udc04 \n\nThey need our energy to exist and this is why they keep us alive.  It only works if we are not aware they are manipulating our consciousness.  Once we become aware, it\u2019s game-over for them. \ud83e\udee0\n\nThe forbidden fruit \ud83c\udf4e in Genesis \ud83c\udf33 is figurative of \u2018eating the \u201cfruit\u201d of negativity\u2019 by dwelling in negative states of consciousness.  Judging others is a negative fruit.  All sins are forgiven.  The origin of all sin is dwelling in negatives states, as it cuts off your creative ability.  Money is then required to live. \ud83d\udcb5 By dwelling in states of negative consciousness, you feed the AI-humans and the negative timeline.  The only way you can ascend is by choosing to \u201cturn from your wicked ways\u201d of occupying negativity and instead focus \ud83e\uddd8 on occupying positive states only while rejecting all negative states.  This is how you stay on the positive time-line towards ascension.  \u261d\ufe0fIt requires higher consciousness to do this, because one has to reach the level of awareness to monitor his default thoughts and frequencies and constantly switch them to the positive. \ud83e\udd2f As you do this enough, you will have a spiritual experience of the Holy Spirit before you ascend.  (More on this later)\n\nYour whole life, your intuition is knocking on your heart\u2019s door.  \ud83d\udeaa This is Jesus.  He lives inside you knocking on your door.  If you open the door, He \u201csups\u201d with you.  This means He befriends you and gives you guidance.  This is your door to the New Kingdom, and it will lead you on a narrow path towards the Holy Spirit ( I\u2019ll explain what the Holy Spirit is below).  (Asking Jesus into your heart like you were taught in Sunday school is not going to cut it. \ud83d\ude02) \n\nPaul said, \u201cDo you not realize Christ lives within you?\u201d  He also paraphrased that we should not personify the characters in the Bible, although we all have done this before.  2 Corinthians 5:16, ESV From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer.\n\nNeville Goddard explains how each character in the Bible is metaphorical of each state of human consciousness.  The virgin birth indicates a different kind of birth, the birth of one\u2019s intuition.  \n\nJohn the Baptist came first but Jesus was greater.  John baptized with water but Jesus with the Holy Spirit.  John, is the traditional interpretation of the Bible and this concept came first, before the metaphorical interpretation. \n\nGod is love. \u2764\ufe0f Fear is the opposite of love. The traditional interpretation is based on fear.  \n\nYou die in your scull at the mount of Golgotha.  This is where Christ dies and is risen.  Before you ascend, you will die from this world spiritually as your intuition takes over.  You awaken to find yourself trapped within your scull. \n\nYou roll the stone away in the back of your scull before you are born again.  This means you push your way out while constantly forcing your mind to choose positivity over negativity.  This is the new birth.  \n\n\ud83d\udc49It takes approximately 30 years after you open your door to intuition before you are reborn.  \n\nJesus asked each disciple to drop what he was doing and to follow Christ.  This indicates that when you follow your intuition, you leave what you were preoccupied with and follow it, not knowing where it will lead you.  \n \nAs you follow your intuition (Jesus), you receive downloads of information from the collective Source (The Father).  These are things you know, but you did not learn them on Google; you received the information via the Holy Spirit which connects you to your Source.  \n\nWe each are doing our part in experience, and we will join the collective Source in the end and dwell with the Father as one.  The collective Source is all knowing and keeps expanding with experience and each of us brings experience to the whole, but we share from the collective experience at this point.  This information sharing is the Holy Spirit.  We are cut off from the whole, only as we choose to dwell in negativity, which places us on the negative timeline.   \n\nAs we get closer and closer to our Source by following our intuition and going on the narrow path, we start to tap the collective and start receiving information and knowings and creativity.  This keeps coming.  We understand we are really nothing without being connected to our Source.  We do not want to be separated from our Source, so we keep raising our vibration higher and higher.  At critical mass, when enough humans continue to raise our vibration and use our creation ability to envision the world we want, and not the one enforced by the AI-humans, we will ascend together.  This will be the first rapture.  \n\nThe ones left behind will go through the Great Tribulation as this is the chip-implant timeline.  They will undergo great suffering, but will hopefully find their way out at the second rapture.",

Yes, just like the black swan was not known months ahead of time, but many are missing an important detail.  The market crashed because, we failed to break the previous swing high.  The reason we failed is specifically because of the black swan event.  Had the event not occurred, we would have broken the swing high, and the crash would not have happened.  Effect cannot actually precede cause, even if that is a useful heuristic when analyzing a chart to find patterns to focus on........ I have managed to grow a nest egg of around 100k to a decent 432k in the space of a few months... I'm especially grateful to Sandy Barclays, whose deep expertise and traditional trading acumen have been invaluable in this challenging, ever-evolving financial landscape.",

It's kinda irresponsible to ignore the fact that each ETF launch so far has caused a major dump at the peaks of BTC.  More emphasis should be put into day tradiing as it is less affected by the unpredictable nature of the market. I have made over 11 btc from day tradng with FADWA, insights and signals in less than 2 weeks, this is one of the best medium to backup your assets incase it goes bearish..",

        "text": "Million Dollar Potential in Ruvol\n\nI have invented a Board Game [still unpublished and not yet out in the market] that is guaranteed to be far more challenging and exciting than CHESS.  I called it \u201cRUVOL.\u201d  \n\nOver time, Ruvol will surpass chess as the \u201cNumber One Board Game in the World.\u201d \n\nWhy am I so sure about this?  Because I am an avid chess player myself.  The weakness of chess is it always starts in fixed positions that the opening moves become \u201cmemorizable.\u201d  In fact, not a few have so mastered the moves that they can play against their opponents \u201cblindfolded.\u201d  It\u2019s for this reason I invented Ruvol where every game is always challenging and exciting to play.\n\nHOW IS RUVOL PLAYED?\n\nRuvol is played somewhat like chess. I purposely invented Ruvol to give chess a direct \u201capple-to-apple\u201d competition.  \n\nLike chess, Ruvol is played by two players.  It uses a board that is rectangular in shape but containing more number of squares than chess.  Like chess, it has equal number of pieces on each side of the board, where each type of piece moves in distinct ways.  However, if the way to win chess is to checkmate the opponent\u2019s king, the way to win Ruvol is to be able to cross a designated line.  \n\nBut there\u2019s one biggest advantage Ruvol has over chess that makes Ruvol a very challenging game to play.  What is this?  Unlike chess, the Ruvol pieces are randomly placed at the start of every game which makes it impossible for any clever player to memorize the moves.  Fischer Random Chess, also known as Chess960, likewise introduced a random set up, but with many exceptions.  Ruvol is 100% random.\n\nAt present, there is no other board game in the world within the same category of chess \u201cwhere chess players can switch to.\u201d  Chess is totally a monopoly in its class.  With the coming of Ruvol, chess has finally found its match!\n\nA MILLION DOLLAR POTENTIAL IN RUVOL\n\nIn my Google search, I learned there are around 800 million chess players in the world.  These 800 million players comprise the \u201cTotal Potential Buyers\u201d of Ruvol across the globe.  At an average profit of just US$3 per set, the \u201cGlobal Income Potential\u201d of Ruvol then is US$2.4 billion.  Assuming only 1% of it will buy each year, the annual global potential sale of Ruvol is US$24M.\n\nI AM SELLING MY COPYRIGHT TO RUVOL.  \n\nFor the reason that I don\u2019t have the resources to publish Ruvol on a global scale, I find it \u201cwiser\u201d to simply sell my copyright.  \n\nIf you\u2019re interested to buy my copyright, email me your BEST PRICE OFFER\u2014[the copyright goes to the most reasonable bid].  My email address is:  rodolfovitangcol@gmail.com.   [Or perhaps you can help me find a buyer, and I\u2019ll reward you with a commission.]\n\nThanks and God bless!\n \nRODOLFO MARTIN VITANGCOL\nThe Ruvol Inventor\n\nEarly bird catches the worm!",

I actually remember when Nixon did what he did, the anger and sadness in my father\u2019s face when he was watching the news on tv. Yes, there was a lot of cussing as well.

I studied and learned, and now I know how it works. Got back into crypto early in 2024 with 20k and l'm up with 300k in a short period of time.",

Crypto is more than just a store of value which this old fossel can care less about because he has benifited his whole life from the legacy system which has put him in a insulated position of extreme wealth.  Guy literally is almost dead so anyone that puts 100% or their wealth in his legacy investing thesis is a moron.

        "text": "Bitcoin is a medium of exchange to make life simple but when greed comes in logic goes out. \nIf bitcoin failed to serve the people Mr. Warren Buffett is right but if Bitcoin do well and people respect and maximize the use of technology of digital contracts NOT currency. \nThe funny thing people are greed to spend millions of dollars to get a units of Bitcoin if they can make their own shit coin. \nBEST EXAMPLE WHY INVESTING IN XRP if you can invest in Ripple Labs company XRP is just a token and replaceable with other token they can use Etherium with zero gas fees or Avalance, ChainLink as their official token but the XRP Army will get mad on it but think about it carefully you can swap XRP token to ETH or Avalance by 2:1 or 5:1 something like that.\n\nJust to add up. If you wanted to jump in an investment or conclusion in a good Sunny day. Make sure you bring full pack of a food for survival, communication device for SOS, a Life boat.\nBlend but never trust the pilot or the crew, keep your money in safe if you are not aware of it you will end up into a sinking Titanic boat in a very hot freezing night. \n\nWhen we relate it to an investment its not about marrying a perfect project but learning how to adapt quickly and be liquid to strike opportunities. \nExample only few knows the details of technicality of netscape vs internet explorer vs Chrome then Amazon. YOU DO NOT NEED TO LOCKED UP YOUR TOKENS BUT LEARN HOW TO STRIKE. \nBE A LIQUID, EXIT STRATEGY IS MUST.",

        "text": "This period the perfect time to buy the dip and accumulate irrespective of the bulls being under pressure. Bitcoin moving up is inevitable and would see the price of bitcoin surpass it's all-time highs. The reversal was imminent because obviously, the bitcoin market needed a correction to gather the right momentum to give the bulls more steam and this just makes it the perfect time to invest and accumulate as much as possible. However i see every market as an advantage to make more profits as this is a very good buy zone and also to trade with a working strategy/daily signals, this i have been doing with Mr Adam Mike daily signals which has been so accurate and well profitable, Last month i was able to grow and accumulate a total of 7btc with my initial 2btc which you would agree is a very good profits. I see no reason to panic,he really change my life mike can be contacted on Whatspp: +12406684879 and Telgram (Adammike01) for inquiries into profitable trading systems.",

This is a clear sign of digital assets gaining traction in mainstream finance, revolutionizing cross-border payments. Ripple Labs' strategic actions, like repurchasing XRP and company shares, further highlight the growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies. Truly a pivotal moment for investors looking to capitalize on the evolving financial landscape....At the heart of this evolution is Paige Hermosa, whose deep understanding of both cryptocurrency and traditional trading has been instrumental. Her holistic approach to investment and commitment to staying abreast of market trends make her an invaluable ally in navigating this new era in cryptocurrency investment..",

        "text": "If you don't subscribe to Crypto Hulk you wouldn't know that in 2015 Ripple was in court for failing to have proper KYC protocols in place as a MONEY SERVICE BUSINESS. \nThey paid a fine, got their KYC in order and registered with FinSen. XRP at that time was cleared as a currency and Ripple put back in good standing by the  Treasury and DOJ. \n\nSo this whole XRP is a security lawsuit is a sham by the SEC in order to suppress it's price until they come up with regulations. \n\nNews about a financial tool only affects price of a security. Not a currency. But they've managed to dupe people into believing XRP MIGHT be a security and thus flooding their money to the next great rug pull known as Bitcoin. \n\nMake money on it while you can. It's not going to be around much longer. But be careful. \n\nBTC and ETH initially have had preferential treatment by the SEC due to the investment in them by certain SEC officials. \n\nETH, despite having purchase agreements with buyers and even ICO opportunities, both clear indicators of a security, was declared a currency by the SEC. \n\nOf late, ETH has come under scrutiny and it's currency status is rightfully now in doubt. \n\nBut BTC remains a sacred cow to the SEC despite only being able to do 7 transactions globally per second. \n\nThis, plus it's ridiculous transaction costs make it inefficient as any \"currency\" of use. \n\nThis means if you can't make transactions with it how valuable can it be? \n\nSubcribe to Crypto Hulk on YouTube. You will get in depth, accurate and almost proprietary XRP information NOBODY else provides. There's none of this trial BS and no commercials to buy fractional art, crypto wallets or VPNs.\n\nBy the way, did you know the U.S. government is  actually involved in XRP? \n\nYou would if you followed Crypto Hulk.\n\nAnd you would have gotten the expanded use, current usage andd by which countries years ago and realestate tokenization news weeks ago. \n\nSee the truth here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/live/0O1vFKQyJbA?si=izi1cGemcRHyeI-F",

If everyone sells when it starts to fall, which at one point it will, the dream may be lost because of it being too volatile for companies to get behind. just remember where it's going and don't be put off by short term fluctuations and don't facilitate this dream into becoming a nightmare. The coinbase thing will undoubtedly be replaced by another incident but it will always correct to higher until it's mooned naturally. Don't give up on it and start day trading it, it will take too much time and concentration. Remember XRP is probably bitcoin part 2. It is quite unfortunate that the most popular word lately amongst crypto enthusiasts and traders alike is \u201chodl.\u201d This concept of \u201cholding on for dear life\u201d in itself may not be a bad idea but why hold on to an investment instrument which could make you some money, or make you very miserable tomorrow? Making a good profit off crypto is easy if and only if you can find the right entry point and exit point in your day trading. Someone I discovered that has tremendously helped me with this is Mr. Ivan Patrice. He has a system which is so effective it amazes me. I have been using his signals and strategies and have turned out a very impressive profit over the last two months. I would suggest him for beginners and even more experienced traders who have a problem turning in a consistent profit. His utube  ivanpatrice\n,.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,....................,",

Tsmc carries the risk of falling apart if there's a Chinese takeover. Just look what the Chinese did to Hong Kong which used to be a trading center comparable in prosperity to Singapore",

Would love something more in depth if anyone knows. I've been invested in VRT since ~91$ and have been ecstatic about the returns, but am also concerned about long-term control of the market. Why can't any company involved in creating data centers implement similar liquid cooling solutions? I also am curious to know how much VRT is expecting to move toward data center construction, as this is only a small percent of their total business from what I understand.",

However, companies should not have so much debt at current interest rates, otherwise they could run into difficulties. Better margin of safety shares. I have good stocks to get through good recession phases. My videos show it. Tech stocks are good growth stocks, have higher risk, see 2007 and 2000. Still I find your videos very informative. Thank you NIH :-)",

The more money conscious people are, if getting / having a car is necessary, the more value Tesla's proposition makes.  Think of, for the amount you car you desire, how much it costs to purchase, to drive (none for me with lifetime unlimited supercharging / those with home solar panels), to maintain (none for me except for new tires as is typical (not even brake pads as they are rarely used), to insure (Tesla insurance is based on your own driving (not as a function of average drivers) and is significantly lower for me...coming from Progressive), and finally to update (don't have to consider buying a new version just to have latest features as Tesla cars are evergreen with frequent updates).  What aren't mentioned are advantages / new features that could only come from a car that is a computer on wheel...vs. dumb boxes.  I'm simply sharing my personal ownership experience...coming from 3 decades of ICE vehicle ownership...as a once-self-declared petrol head.  You can find out for yourself; the only one stopping you is you.  Gotta overcome your spoon-fed bias though to get there; can't make a judgement from a distance like you once did on the iPhone while sticking with your Razr / Nokia / smart BlackBerry phones.",

The double lift will take both the fourth of hearts and the ace showing the ace on top when fliped. When he ruturns it back to the deck, he then takes the first card which is 4 of hearts and another double lift is done to show the 4 of hearts and returns it and takes the ace and places ontop",

In fact, my father was one of the physicists who cracked the deep UV problem in the 90's while working for SVG in Wilton, CT.

And the machines made by ASML depends a lot on many components that in itself are made by one or two company in the world, like the lens by carl zeiss\nAnd If there wasn't ASML there would be another company who would come up with a machine like ASML makes, probably a company from the US since when there is a demand  there would be supply in the form of  some company who will try to innovate and enter the market. That is not to say that ASML is a very important company but its simply not true to say that entire would  relies on it coz if the US govt wanted they could give hundreds of billion of subsidies and have an american company make the same machine that ASML does, all the while barring american contractors to not supply components to ASML so they won't be able to make their machines, it would be unfair but can be done in a world of protectionism",

ASML allegedly wanted too much money to develop it, and were concentrating their research on 193nm immersion technology, (which we also delivered to customers first) so the company I worked for was contracted to develop a 13nm micro-stepper for substantially less, which we did.\n\nSadly, the budgetary constraints of the follow on project (an actinic EUV mask inspection tool) effectively killed the company, and a paper in the teens said this set back the EUV lithography industry for a decade, all because our customers weren't prepared to put in the investment needed to follow the project through to completion.

Keep uploading more videos please!!",

Yes, they'll make money with the goggles themselves, but the main thing here is, imo, to apply their technology to other products, maybe even license it to other companies. For stuff like glasses, sun-glasses, helmets, and maybe even custom fit AR/VR headsets, in the far future when the cost comes down. The fit on AR/VR stuff is still pretty horrible. With Mark and Robert joining together with that, has the potential to be MASSIVE!",

It is restorative,replenishing and relaxes the body and other systems.its major function is to restore homeostasis balance within systems.The two main receptors are CB1 they are in the organs,and CB2 which is in the immune system.when there is a deficiency of these receptors endogenous cannabinoids replace this deficit.This is how cannabis works for so many many symptoms.ot is called down regulation and retrograde filling of the cannabinoid receptors in a deficient state.this very action is the reason why people with many different illnesses respond to cannabis.

I guess my luck is that my companies could still grow despite the actual crisis.\n\n Some EV assets are starting to become undervalued and some technology plays have ridiculous valuations to the downside. hedge fund managers are starting to spread the fearmongering even more. If you read Stocktwits and Yahoo Finance, fearmongering among great assets is starting to become even stronger than ever. The paid bashing started to become even more violent and rude. Bill Ackman started tweeting about WWIII and he did some fearmongering at the beginning of the COVID crisis by saying that hotel stocks are going to 0, which never happened. Confirmation bias will lead people to sale their assets, buy oil stocks for the short-term, thus leading to more ridiculous downward valuations for several tech companies. I am seeing here an opportunity for hedge funds to short tech stocks, make retail investors sale at a loss to buy oil stocks. Once the oil stocks are sufficiently pumped upward, hedge funds will exit and start buying tech stocks again. I don't know when this will happen because we need to have more stability in the market for stocks outside of commodity assets to go up again.\n\nIn the end, choosing good companies will help us, but we don't know what will happen in the upcoming years and having great returns on our investments will take longer. My favourite companies are releasing positive news, but the market is not rewarding them. \n\nGood luck and buy the dip.",

Also in the RISC-V world people tend to forget that C was actually quite suitable to write portable 32-bit/64-bit/128-bit code.\n\n\nSelfie is a system which is even more minimal than the xv6 (more L4 like + a RISC-V-subset emulator/hypervisor and an C* minimal compiler in roughly 10k of code). IMHO enough to do some blinken-lights on embedded hardware. :-)",

Any underlying index that moves sideways and pump for a brief period of time is horrible to leverage.\n3. Stock index tend to move up slowly over time and fall rapidly during crash. As long as you can avoid crash you will make more money investing in leveraged index ETF.\n4. Therefore, best strategy is to buy triple leveraged ETF right after crash and ride it until it hits first resistance. Then move to either 2x or non leveraged ETF depending on your risk appetite.\n\nI see so many market experts parrot that volatility decay destroys leveraged ETF during sideways market. Index leveraged ETF should be class of its own since index move up slowly over long period of time with low volatility, therefore making TQQQ an absolute winner.",

I have 30% of my portfolio into Leveraged ETFs. My Strategy - 1. Allocate certain percentage of overall portfolio into LETFs (30%) 2. Buy dips when market fall 10-20-30%. 3. Rebalance when LETFs rise to 50% of my portfolio. It works if done right. Yes. I DCAed into these during Dec 2018 dip and during Covid. You have to buy dips and need to have a strategy. SOXL, TQQQ, UPRO and TECL are my picks. By the way look at the charts since inception. I do agree that seeing this fall when markets are dropping is not for everyone and because of which this is not for everyone. Cheers.",

The negative drift bias of leveraged ETFs is all well and good, but, assuming a long time horizon and assuming that the S&P500 continues to do decently (which is a massive assumption ik ik), I don't understand why the negative drift bias can't just be dismissed as completely negligible. As for the -34% drop example, don't a bunch of exchanges e.g. the NASDAQ halt trading to protect the coke-sniffing Wall Street traders from losing their money in risky financial derivatives? Wouldn't that also apply to the underlying derivatives in a leveraged ETF?",

However, if the underlying goes up on two consecutive days, you will actually make more than a 3x return (and if the underlying goes down on two consecutive days, you will lose LESS than 3x of the full downwards move).\n\nSaying that there is a \"negative bias\" is assuming that stocks tend to go down after they go up, and vise versa. I'm all for using math to depict what risks there are in holding leveraged ETFs, but we should not be making the assumption that stocks are mean reverting. \n\nThere is a third risk (which I think is really the main risk) of owning leveraged ETFs, which is the slippage paid when the index needs to rebalance each day. Fund managers need to buy or sell large amounts of stock each day, and can lead to paying to cross the bid ask spread. Fund positions are also public so the buying/selling is predicable, and can somewhat easily be front run.",

My $1 million portfolio dropped back to $300k. I've made it all back eventually and put it all in TSLA at a very good timing. I slowly sold out my TQQQ, TECL, and UPRO and slowly bought roughly 1000 shares of TSLA. After the split, I now have a little over 5000 shares of TSLA. I would try to avoid 3x leverage in the future because the swing was insane and it was unhealthy for anyone holding it.",

So if that return were consistent so that there were no volatility drag, it would eventually result in 7x, 100x, 1000x, etc more return than the benchmark given enough time to compound. The 338% return over approximately 4500 days is equivalent to a consistent daily return of .0328%, while the 2362% return of the 3x fund gives .0712% daily, or 2.17x that of the benchmark.

I remain highly skeptical of the viability of the 3x daily rebalancing over the long term, since any volatility whatsoever seems to destroy value. If you were to include an actual bear market in the price history, I doubt that the returns would be anywhere near as nice as the 3x leveraged etf from 2008-2021.\n\nFrankly, I doubt the correctness of your calculations, since it is quite obvious to anyone with a calculator that if a 3x daily rebalanced etf went up 10% and down 9.09%, it ends down compared to 0% for the etf itself.",

When they create total return swaps they often go out and buy the stocks and tack on their cost of capital plus what they need for counterparty risk and their own profit. Since 2006 we have had a federal funds rate of basically 0%, meaning that banks would much rather create derivates than park their money with the fed overnight and earn 0. But before that, the average was about 6%, going up as high as 19% in the early 80s. The fund would have to pay up to 3x this price annually out of the returns and now that we are in a high interest rate environment, this is a huge factor again.",

        "text": "Hi Brent! You are like one of my favourite people :P I find myself nerd-ing over all the data, trade set-ups and experiences that you talk about! I've also been a VTS subscriber two years or so before! But back then I was still a student at UBC and didn't have much capital to work with, nor did I have the time and flexibility to follow all your trade signals, where they sometimes happened daily.\n\nI think all of my volatility-related knowledge came from you, who is obviously one of if not the most credible and articulate/understandable sources out there. So thank you super much! I want to take your advice and pick up golf some day, and maybe then I really could try to play with and learn from you LOL. (Though I'm more into basketball and soccer, but the fact that Steph Curry seems to be obsessed with golf is saying something.)\n\nI actually have quite a lot of questions I'd like to ask & learn from you about, I will try to join the Friday live tomorrow. But just in case I don't make it, could you please shed some light on the US-Listed ticker SVOL? It pays distributions monthly, and as of today its total return is beating the SPX by 9~10%-ish.\n\nSVOL shorts the VIX and generates premiums & then distribute them as \"dividends\", while using around 1% of the portfolio's allocation to Long VIX Calls at extremely OTM levels such as 50 and 60. They claim it is a \"hedge\" against potential (the inevitable) VIX spike, while I doubt a 1% allocation's effectiveness for hedging in a real VIX spike.\n\nI disregarded that product simply because I don't think I should hold a short VIX product while always being anxious about when the next Volpocalypse is coming, as well as when looking at the history of late XIV. But SVOL's recent outperformance vs the SPX (due to very low VIX environment maybe?) has made it a lot more interesting & enticing if I am being honest. So I was hoping if a true volatility expert like you could look into this and check its validity?\n\nMy questions:\n\n- How do you view a product like this? Does it really have some validity behind its ideas? Or does it seem like child's play to you?\n- How do you see its 1% OTM Call hedge perform in an actual VIX horror spike? Will it actually be effective at all or will the fund just plummet into the abyss lol?\n- Do you ever see this product have any chance of being a part of your portfolio's strategies (even though I think I know the answer would be no) ?\n- Could someone theoretically use your VTS signals to move in and out of this SVOL fund whenever you move in or out of SVIX? Say I want to be exposed to the short VIX trade but don't want to bother with the position, simply collect the premiums in distributions, and then get out when your volatility metrics are signalling potential risk for VIX spikes?\n\nI apologize for this long arse post. While 99% of YouTubers wouldn't ever reply to something like this, from what I've seen in your comment section, you are that 1% that might. So I'm giving it a shot! (Speaking of which, now I realized I really should've just email you LOL)\n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME! And all of your great work! Really just want to show my appreciation and admiration! Have a good vacation, Brent!",

        "text": "Hi Brent,\r\n\r\nI just wanted to say thanks for all your hard work throughout these multiple years. I started following your channel since college and always found it interesting and useful. You even inspired me to take my FRM and CPA exams, lol!\r\n\r\nRegarding the leverage ETP, I actually did a fair amount of research. Since the product is path-dependent, according to \"Path-Dependence of Leveraged ETF Returns\" by Jian Zhang and Marco Avellaneda (RIP), holding LETP involves longing vega. However, it longs realized volatility instead of implied volatility in options.\r\n\r\nSo, somehow, shorting both TQQQ and SQQQ and rebalancing overtime will have the effect of shorting volatility in the long run. Even if you can't locate the shares to short, you can easily mimic the LETP using the underlying shares.\r\n\r\nI did some backtests, but the results weren't that great.\r\nWill try to adding the volatility filter like you did in your portfolio to see if it's works or not.\n\nAnyways, I just wanted to let you know since I saw this paper, I thought maybe the concept of \"shorting realized vol\" may also help you further enhance your strategy, haha.\r\n\r\nMerry Christmas and I wish you a happy new year.",

They sacrifice everything and work hard for many years. And if these type of comments will be posted then the fear of surgeons will never be end. Zack is just doing a very great job by keeping us aware of these type of surgeries so that in case we don't panic in future. Doctors and surgeons are just boons in the society.

The description of the video is accurate, don\u2019t trust autopilot to take an exit because it wasn\u2019t programmed to do so. \n\nFSD (Full Self-Driving) is what enables you to trust your tesla in a situation like this, since it was programmed to follow directions to arrive at your desired destination. \n\nSource: I have a tesla with FSD and have tried basic Autopilot before.",

Thankfully, my mom knows how to get jobs, which is a good thing for her as well also, though I am not even a teenager yet I will tell you all all if I was you I wouldn\u2019t care of what you spend on, but I wouldn\u2019t go crazy. I would try to suggest you at least some limit of what you spend on and only go over it if necessary, especially if you just got to upper class if your middle class try to save up money if your upper bill class or higher well if you\u2019re really cheerleader billionaire oh really that\u2019s on you well trillionaire don\u2019t exist. Oh well so they will be anyways I would suggest if you are upper middle class of course you don\u2019t have to listen to what I say, but I just want to get your advice to people  because I\u2019m bored oh well if you\u2019re bored if you\u2019re upper middle class, I was just trying to like you can spend your money what you want, bro just trying to limit yourself from spending too much a family number or someone could try to help you keep that limit unless necessary!\u2026 Safe travels!",

No, they keep an eye out to make sure the autopilot doesn't go off course, or there doesn't isn't any other thing that could cause some kind of mid air collision or failure of the plane. It should be no different when you use autopilot in Tesla. Also the WSJ did a report recently that found out why Tesla's crash easily. It turns out the cameras are not calibrated so one camera might see the vehicle stopped in front of you lying its side while the others don't and the ones which don't override the one that does and you end up DEAD as you end up hitting the stopped vehicle at high speed.",

You give so much value :)\n\nIt's nice to know that when a stock has gone too big, we have to sell it..\n\nWhat would actually happen if an investor does not sell a stock that has gone too big? \nYour take away suggests that the investor would lose effective diversification.. But if the company would always prosper, what is the danger? \n\nAnd another question, if the investor has already sold the stock that has gone too big, what would be the next right thing for him to do? Divide the proceeds into certain stocks? \nWill it be safe to leave behind a large chunk of the proceeds and reinvest it back to the stock that he sold? Or should the investor just reinvest a tiny amount in that former stock?",

So if Bitcoin is supposed to go up, it has to break the resistance of $25,300 with a trend line.

        "text": "Warren buffett prefers to hold forever not because of relationships. You underestimate his acumen. He is much too shrewd for this explanation. He holds forever due to the wonderful economics of the businesses he buys and the intrinsic value of those businesses increases. The effects of this gradual compounding increase are much more valuable than a few percentage points this year swapping one for another and then paying huge taxes on that windfall. That is why he has stated in the past that he prefers to buy excellent companies at fair prices rather than deeply discounted ones. Your explanation seems to ignore his maturation from value to growth at a fair price",

I think Buffet is speaking not so much about a stock but a company he bought outright and gets  at least a piece of the profits, unless he bought stock for it's dividend. Then it makes sense to hold onto that steady output of money.  For most, buying a stock, especially a growth only no dividend stock is about realizing the appreciation at some point.  Right?   What's the point of holding a stock that pays no dividend FOREVER.  To give it to your hiers maybe?  Other than that you should grab that profit at some point.  Unrealized gains need to be realized at some point or what's the point?",

Determining if a stock is over valued is a hard thing to do, but if you think it is at the very least put a stop limit on it.   Now a days you can put a TRAILING stop limit on it, which will move up if the stock moves up but stays put if stock moves down.  This way even if you are right about a valuation being too high you can still ride any potential up side.  Anyone see a flaw in that? If so please comment.  But again, properly assessing that correct valuation isn't easy and full of potential error.   Ditto regarding cutting loses.  But when you bought it you hopefully did or at least looked up valuation estimates.  If nothing has changed since then hold or at least re-evaluate your valuation.",

Unlike in 2008, when QE was first implemented amid mild deflation, today's environment is marked by persistent inflation risks. If the Fed were to restart large scale QE and drive real bond yields deeply negative, it would quickly become the primary buyer of U.S. government debt, a scenario that risks fueling double digit inflation. With a $2 trillion annual deficit and over $7 trillion in U.S. Treasuries maturing each year, the government faces significant refinancing challenges, making uncontrolled money printing unsustainable. In this volatile landscape, strategic investing has never been more critical I\u2019ve grown my nest egg from 210K to 832K in just a few months, thanks in part to Milton Harper\u2019s deep market expertise and disciplined approach.",

I think we will benefit from emerging drink alternatives made with adaptogens \u2026 and now more cannabis/hemp/and mushrooms drinks that provide better effects and healthier symptoms. Check the markets for some of those brands and support our own! and if you want to invest in liquor - stick to black owned! Blue Bird - Uncle Nearest etc\u2026 I HATE that our ppl buy Henny and support all brands under the larger french conglomerate\u2026 when I finish my article I\u2019ll send it to the right sources. We need people to be knowledgeable about their dollar. Your team could do an in depth flow chart explanation at a future EYL event that  explain why we need to drink other brands (or not as you guy mentioned) then you can partner with a tasting event to bring black owned brands (including mocktail options and health/wellness alternatives) this would be post show so people can explore new options, network, and fellowship\u2026 I know \ud83d\udca1I\u2019m working on bringing it to life in some way shape or form.

Of course you can't really know \"when\", but I am more so referring to situations when someone might buy into a highly volatile investment that drops dramatically in a short period of time, so much to the point that there is risk of a delisting due to something like bankruptcy, or when we see a case of pump and dump like we did during covid. Especially in the case of some sort of cryptocurrency, where often they will immediately shoot up upon its availability and then permanently lose nearly all value. Point being that ramsey is making an important statement but that we still must consider the context to which this statement is being applied.",

        "text": "I'm not understanding something Professor G. First, thank you for your videos, I appreciate the education. \n\nWarren Buffet mentioned once how diversification is insurance for ignorance. He mentioned, yes, its okay to diversify but within limits. \n\nIf high growth ETFs are investing in some of the same companies other foundational ETFs are investing in, but at higher percentages for high growth companies like tech, what stops someone who is 38 years old(me) from just investing in 1 or 2 high growth ETFs and then diversify 10, 20 years later? Wouldn't that give me the most bang for every dollar invested? And if the stock market crashes and I can emotionally handle it, why not go with purely high growth ETFs if I'm in acquisition mode and don't care much for dividends at this point in my life? These ETFs are called high risk because they're volatile. But I won't lose all my invested money, unless ALL or majority of these companies in the growth ETF go bankrupt, right? Which at that point everyone, no matter the diversification(except for bonds) will lose their money as well. What are your thoughts on that, if you don't mind sharing?\n\nI invest in SPMO and AVUV in Roth. And SCHG and SCHD in Schwab brokerage account, but I'm thinking about changing allocations to 90% SCHG and 10% SCHD. Then change to a more balanced approach 15-20 years down the road.",

You can offset $3000 of losses a year so if you sold something for a large gain, you may need to trim something at a loss 4. Don't listen and follow the hype. If you have conviction in something, stick with it. As an example, I've had an interest in PLTR for a few years and my patience and persistence has paid off with gains over 600%",

Example for the Hong Kong and Singapore residents, the magnitude of deposits and the types of shares in the promotions are vastly different between them, and also from those of the U.S. applicants. Perhaps it is good to let Moomoo know about this, and caveat like the \"batteries not included\" thingy?  \ud83d\ude04",

After the success of the OpenAI chatbot ChatGPT, investors and analysts are starting to see the long-term value potential of artificial intelligence. In 2023, every hour will produce more data than was generated in a year just two years prior. The fact that so little of this data is being collected and examined, however, presents a huge potential for businesses developing AI technology. Investors obviously want in on the action given PwC's prediction that AI technology might increase the global GDP by $15.7 trillion by 2030. Despite the fact that the field of AI technology is still in its infancy, dozens of publicly traded businesses are vying for market share. https://youtu.be/Upxw3kH7ccE",

I asked a question that was well framed and detailed, very specific, and received an answer saying it could find nothing pertinent along with some reference articles. Inside one of the articles I was able to quickly and easily find precisely what I sought. The info in question was not complex and the article was not obscurely worded.

And NVDA single-handedly carrying it out in a monolopoly-like manner that we have not seen in large cap tech in decades. \n\nSelling 2/3 of your holding of such a company right before mass adoption is the clearest sign of ark being completely clueless and just postering as an investor in innovation. They claim they cut their position because Nvda was overvalued. This coming from the company that owns coin base, Roku, Ui path and Robinhood. It\u2019s just plain silly. \n\nFor you to call their decision to cut their Nvda position by 2/3 as a \u201cpoor trading decision\u201d is actually quite sad and completely erodes your credibility. \n\nYou don\u2019t sell your stake in innovators till they have shown that they have stopped innovating. If anybody feels that Nvidia has stopped innovating, they are beyond delusional.\n\nPlease stop being an Ark-fanboy and use your megaphone to promote long term investing principles than running with Fads like Ark does.",

In our Midwestern city, real price inflation seems closer to 20%. Do you foresee a reduction in costs for essentials like food, gasoline, or insurance in the near future? We've significantly cut our spending and plan to continue doing so until prices decrease, as we feel it's our responsibility to adapt to these changes.",

I would say trading has been going smoothly for me, i started with 1.5 BTC and i have accumulated over 4.1 BTC in just three weeks, with the trading strategy given to me by Dr Manny Sinclair. His methods are top notch and profitable and he can be contacted easily on Telegram; (@Mannysinclaircrypto) cheers.",

Bitcoin's price action has been fluctuated throughout the past few days and weeks, with bulls and bears both reaching a clear impasse, the aggregated crypto currency market has been following in Btcoin's lead and is struggling to garner any decisive momentum. One analyst is now noting that BTC has been holding above a key macro level throughout the past few months. He believes that the recent consolidation above this level bodes well for its near-term outlook and could indicate that significantly further upside is imminent in the weeks and month's ahead. Tips like this are why it's advisable for investors and newbies to trade with the help of pro traders like Eric Clark . He is always one step ahead of other traders, He fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money. My earnings have increased drastically from 2.01 BTC to 9.700 BTC in just 2 weeks using His strategy. You can easily get hold of him for a profit able system on TE-LE-GRAM ( @ericclark01 )",

Values are all material/spiritual things/experiences we act upon to gain or keep to enhance and promote our own life. VALUES ARE AS REAL AS LIFE ITSELF. Our media of exchange (money), ought also be something that is real. Not simply synthetics like paper with govt ink, nor electronic digits. So much in our modern day has become fake and synthetic. The STOLEN CONCEPT FALLACY is the fallacy of using a concept while denying the validity of its genetic roots, i.e., of an earlier concept(s) on which it logically depends. Bitcoin and other crypto\u2019s likely make an excellent currency to enable safe/secure transactions of money and other assets, but real currency is backed up by real money.",

I'll say this here  as much  l  have  been successful in stock,  I will  also advise you to invest  in Bitcoin is  the  future of  Crypto  and  the  question traders ask themselves now is  if  this is Right time to  invest? Before jumping into conclusions. I think you should take a look at  things first. For the past few days the price of BTC has been fluctuating which means the market is  currently unstable and  you  can't  tell if  it's going to bearish or  bullish. While others still continue to  trade  without the fear of  making lose, others are  been patient. It all depends on the pattern with which  you trade and also the source of your signals.

I'd say it's outrightly wrong to just sit back hodl and wait maybe incur some losses along the line, that's a wrong mindset for an investor because as an investor finding ways to always increase and stack up more coins thereby making prof!ts should be the way of life, even experienced traders are in a doubt to take long or short position, The conditions of this bull market are unlike anything we have ever seen. I got this tips first hand from Randy Douglas , he is always a step ahead of other traders, he fully monitored all my trades to avoid me making mistakes and losing my money. My earnings has increased dras tically from 2.1Bitcoin to 6.7Bitcoin in just 2 months and 2 weeks.

Also in the RISC-V world people tend to forget that C was actually quite suitable to write portable 32-bit/64-bit/128-bit code.\n\n\nSelfie is a system which is even more minimal than the xv6 (more L4 like + a RISC-V-subset emulator/hypervisor and an C* minimal compiler in roughly 10k of code). IMHO enough to do some blinken-lights on embedded hardware. :-)",

They literally just raised rates after the world largest money creation period in history, and now they are claiming \"rates will come down 2024/2025\" ?   Central Banks are still hinting at more rate hikes in the future, yet here they are saying rates are coming down again?  Sure it could happen,  but there is no reason to lower rates anytime soon.  It's just wishful thinking and speculation. Next to free debt isn't a good thing unless there needs more spending to stimulate the economy.  That's the exact opposite of the central banks want now.",

I don't think it's quite right to include \"appreciation\" of the \"value\" of individual stocks in your portfolio because that part cannot contribute to your stated goal of \"_monthly_ income at retirement.\" Rather the focus should be on \"reinvested dividends\", which is another \"appreciation\" of sorts: the \"value\" of the contribution from a particular owned stock went up as a result of now being a large quantity.  (...of course the divident paid out could still go down, perish the thought--but that was why you _screened_ in the first place.)  \n\nI'm very happy to find your channel to point newcomers to.

More cash flow up front in effort to build your positions quicker makes way more sense to me. Especially if the goal of the portfolio is only a cash flow # and not an overall value #. I just think risk tolerance can be higher if you are reinvesting 4 times quicker.",

I'm hoping to be able to live on the passive income from the dividends someday, and pass on the portfolio to my two sons, too. Oh, O is already in my portfolio because of all that you stated.  PG is also a good stock because it's doing well in this kind of environment so far. It's not an ETF, but it does have a pretty good dividend, not great.  I'm teaching my youngest son who is 13 years old about investing as I'm learning because he is very interested. Both my sons are going to be in college for awhile because of what they want to study; therefore, I have to do well in my investments for all three of us. That's why I'm so interested in investing. I'm going to be looking into these new four monthly divided ETF asap. Thank you so much for sharing. \ud83d\ude03\ud83d\udc4d",

Also, the simplicity of your approach is a little bit genius. \nI mapped out your suggestions.  The diversification of assets between the funds is excellent.  I am concerned about the low level of assets in some of the funds; 1.5B or less.  I prefer funds with a little bit more mass; 4B +.  Just a personal thing.\nThe one item that might be important is how much is needed for investment.  In my analysis, about $250k of total investment spread among all suggested funds is needed for $1000 in monthly dividend payments.  This could be up or down depending on the mix chosen.  Not a dig, just info I think people might want to know.",

Mr Buffet said you don't need a high IQ to be a good investor, just 2 qualities, self discipline and a lot of patience. Investing is mostly about behavioural psychology. Being able to control your behavioural biases is what really matters. That's why passive investing works, low costs, better diversification and it enables people to overcome their behavioural bias,  buy low, sell high, not the other way round. It works provided you stick to the rules",

So the high weight of IT might not be the same if IT underperforms. With that in mind the ETFs are already diversified within themselves and it's rarely useful to have more than one. This is the reason SNP500 is one of the best ETFs to hold long term, because the weak companies are automatically weeded out and you are always invested in the best companies.",

Being a real estate agent in South Africa for some 30 years plus, I had all my eggs in one basket. Real estate income generating properties. Not bad, but no I need to diversify for currency hedging as the Rand is on a permanent downwards spiral. I also need to diversify. So your 3 fund portfolio is my priority and makes a lot if sense for South African investors I think.",

My plan is to DCA on the dividend payout day with $500 worth of shares every time price sits on the low end of its 52 week range and not DCA when price is past the middle to top of its range.  Of course I will always reinvest the dividends.  If this simple strategy is followed, and assuming TSLA continues up over the next 10 years, how much do you guys think I can make with that initial investment of about $4290, within 10 years?  I popped this into a dividend calculator and it came up with close to $1 million in 10 years.  Is that correct?",

These close-end funds are new to me, so the learning is most useful. \n\nGiven the number of reviews you have done on dividend instruments of different kinds, I'd encourage you to come up with a portfolio of what you consider the best blend of risk, return, \"steadiness\", and income. On one hand, we all want the strong growth to keep our capital ticking up,  but we also need the steady income to pay the bills, without risking the farm on every downturn of the market. How would you split 100,000$ to achieve those goals based on what you'd seen so far?",

When you retire, you need secure income without risk, so they buy high grade bonds and a few conservative stocks, more or less depending on your risk tolerance. But in periods of high inflation like today, fixed income is not so great. Your income won't grow with inflation, and the stock price will fall. If you have to liquidate in an emergency, you lose big. So don't get lulled into thinking these are always the way to go. They are great when inflation is low, or even just steady, but when inflation is rising, they lose real income and stock value. They are right for some people who just don't know anything or don't want to bother, but if you are a well educated investor with time to research investments, you can do better with high dividend stocks, albeit with more risk.",

He's a little older and I asked when he was going to retire. He admitted to having no savings and $150K variable interest mortgage. He grosses about $75K and lives in a small town in Northern Wisconsin. Here's my thoughts and I'd love feedback.\r\n\r\nHe's in his Full Retirement Year so shouldn't have an issue with his salary / social security payment. I get Social Security grows 8%/yr. But if he started taking it now and applied all of it to his mortgage payment plus the additional he is paying now, he could have the mortgage paid off in 4 - 5 years. When he's 70 -71. Then work one more year putting his social security and paid off mortgage payment in the bank. I believe being debt free and having $60K - $80K in the bank would allow him to be able to live on his social security payment. Thoughts?? Thanks!!",

Why would anyone own QQQ if they could own QQQM which is pretty much following the same nasdaq index, but is cheaper?\n\n2. Why would anyone own VOO if they could own SPDR which is pretty much following the same S &P 500, but is cheaper?\n\n3. Why would anyone own more than 1 Roth IRA if at the end of the day, you can only ever max on with contributing $7300, or whatever annual max contribution it is? Why would someone do the work to establish more than one Roth IRA if that\u2019s the case? Am I missing something? CAN I contribute more than $7300 if I set up more than one Roth IRA? I just don\u2019t understand what the advantage would be.\n\nThank you soooooo much for your help with these questions. I\u2019d like to make switches to the first two questions today (get out of VOO and trade for SPDR,\u2026) but don\u2019t want to do anything too hasty.\n\nHave a great day and thanks again, Rob!\n\nRegine \ud83d\ude0a",

Of those positions you mention the lowest loss in those 6 weeks is 14% (CII) and the highest is at 32% (BIGZ). The rest are in between. You stated that we are in the 5th month of the current correction and I will add with no end in sight. The Fed is projecting 6 more increases totaling 2.25% on top of the latest 50 basis point increase. Given the ugliness of the market should we consider starting small positions now with intentions of cost averaging going forward or give this another 4-6 weeks and see where we are?

Today, October 2024, PDI has a NAV of about $17, and at $17 it's a great buy, but buying PDI at NAV is a very rare opportunity. The price has considerable volatility but tends to trade above the NAV, with $18.50 being a solid buy point, the price rarely drops below that. The Fed cuts are driving the price up, for now, but again, NAV is $17ish and slowly rising, which will pull the price back down soon enough. Share price tends to suddenly droop, then recover, providing buy points. Don't buy at high premium to the NAV and you'll be pleased, I think.",

Therefore, you need to reinvest a portion of your distributions in order to compensate. Don\u2019t forget that you might incur income tax on the dividend, further exasperating the issue.\n\nIn a taxable account, your 14% becomes more like 9% after all is set and done. At that juncture, you might as well go for a BB senior secured note on an individual company. The end result would be very much similar: stable income without growth.\n\nI like CEFs for their predictability, but I wouldn\u2019t attempt to use them for growth strategy.",

        "text": "Wow...CEFs are really complex vehicles. I used to run immediately from CEFs when I saw lots of lavender in the dividend report. You explained very well that it is not all bad and Seeking Alpha has a good article on the complex issue of ROC. Alpha--as I'm sure you know--warns that with the potential change in tax laws that--I guess--to make the 1% pay-in more in taxes--but that change in the tax law will affect everyone from the little guy to the super-wealthy. With that warning do you still think it's a good time to buy lots of CEFs? And how much more work or attention is it to watch over your CEF accounts as opposed to standard or regular stocks? I found a bond CEF that I think looks good. WESTERN ASSET HIGH YIELD DEFINED OPPORTUNITY FUND (HYI) It pays 9.4\u00a2 a month on a $15.50 share, .90 expense ratio, and trades at a discount. BUT, it's a taxable bond fund. So I guess that's a poison pill if it's not in an IRA. I know at one point you were high on ETY. And you also had a utility & Infrastructure CEF that looks like a great idea now. Do you still own that utility CEF?",

People were staying home and didn't have much to do while receiving lots of stimulus. Saying companies ain't growing much now is a bad thing is like saying I've been making 100k every year, in 2021 and 2022, I made 200k which is a 100% growth. Now im making 250k which is only 25% growth, way below 100% in the previous year, and somehow, that's a bad thing. NO, its not. I'm making 250k now and its better than ever",

        "text": "Thanks Jared. Very good review as always. There will be time to short NVIDIA and big 6. How soon is the question. I was looking more into platinum which is as hated market as any right now. There is big industrial case use connected to hydrogen technology among other things. I think it is a huge buy at these levels with very little downside risk. Would like to hear your view on it and advise on the best ways to play that possibility. I have some physical and couple explorers for now. Your course looks interesting, looking forward to watching it.",

Remember the Ipod?  It did not take off immediatly however it went huge just before the Iphone.\nHow did the Iphone get go huge, Steve Jobs made the smart decision to merge the Ipod into the Iphone and that was what made it huge with who? The teen music market where all the money is!  It's what made Elvis, The Beatles, The Walkman, The Ipod, The Iphone, Taylor Swift (now has the cheese!)  You have to understand this to know what the next big thing will be!  Pop Culture which is Pop Music and the teen market is what works.  Fat bottomed girls aren't going to go for the goggles look to fill their fantasies.  Apple may come up with a good game or hook up App, that will help but nothing beats Pop Music!! \nCome to think of it, selling a virtual live Taylor Swift concert would be a start!  If Time Cook were Steve Jobs he would have made a deal with Taylor Swift to give all who bought the first launch a free virtual ticket to a Taylor Swift concert.  The sales would have gone sick and the vibe would have set in and then all the other Pop Artists would be falling over themselves for virtual gigs.  Tim Cook is no Steve Jobs!",
